## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project we will follow the steps of CRISP-DM Process to analyze the data related to housing rental serves for Seattle city. Using this data we will try to find answers to some of the interesting question that can give us some insight in a business point of view.

1. What features are most important ?
2. Is there any relation between neighbourhood and rental price ?
3. Is there any variance in mean price vs weekday ? Is there any relation between variance in mean price and months/season ? 
4. What are the keywords to write an attractive description for posting a listing ?
5. What are the important amenities/extra service/extra facilities to attract quests ?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 4 files available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
1. CRISP-DM_Seattle_AirBNB.ipynb: This files contains the steps followed and code pursued to find answers to above question. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
2. README.md: This file gives an overview about the project, data used and the packages or libraries used in this project. 
3. Data files: Two data files were used in this project "calendar.csv" and "listings.csv". 
	"Calender.csv" contains the clendar dates, listing  availablilty and rental price of on that date if listing is available.
	"listings.csv" contains the many feature like details about host, details about house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, area 		of house, host response rate, neighbourhood etc.
